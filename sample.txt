Hello there,ðŸ‘‹

I named my project as: "Vote it out".

Features added: 1.Sign-up, 2.Sign-in, 3.Sign-out, 4.Display list of created elections, 5.Create new elections, 6.Naming an election while creating it.

I have attached a PDF file that shows every functionality of "Vote it out". Vote it out.pdf

I have added 5 tests and all of them passed while committing the changes.tests passing pic.png

I have not removed the "Stop election" button which appears to be red, for the elections that have already ended. So clicking it would just do nothing.

I have not completed the results page, and also for now, the ongoing election results page and the results page after the election has ended is same.Screenshot from 2023-01-15 18-44-50.png

I have added the input fields for the question and description, and also disabled them for now, I'll add functionality to them soon.Screenshot from 2023-01-15 18-45-45.png

I didn't add the functionality to delete an election, as i didn't feel it as that important. But i'll add it soon.

I faced some loading issues, I don't know if its only for me or for everyone. So if you face the same issue, please be patient and wait for it to load.

I have faced some issues while clicking on the "svg icons", I didn't know what the error was but, I think its just problem of not clicking on them accurately. So if you click on an "svg icon" and if it doesn't respond, please I request you to patiently click on the "svg icon" accurately 1-2 times.

The repository is public now, but previously I put it in private, as I was afraid that someone will copy the code, and that my code would get plagiarised.

I have tested "Vote it out" and I didn't find any errors, if you find any errors please let me know, so that I can fix them as soon as possible.

Thankyou sir/madam.
